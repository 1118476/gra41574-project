Hello! Please unpack player_data before running the code🙏🏻. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
build_player_data can't be run without seasons and leagues specific data, which we do not upload due to its size. It was used to build player_data.csv. 
You can run it by simply running run.py in the terminal or by specifying type of encoder: run.py --encoder label/onehot
